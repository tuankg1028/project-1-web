  abstract  = {Access control is a key service of any data management system. It allows regulating the access to data resources at different granularity levels on the basis of access control models which vary on the protection options they offer. The more powerful is the access control model in terms of protection requirements, the more difficult is for security administrators to understand the effect of a set of access control policies on the protected resources. This is further complicated within schemaless systems, like NoSQL datastores, when fine grained access control policies are specified for data resources characterized by heterogeneous structures. The lack of a reference data model and related manipulation languages exacerbates this issue. To the best of our knowledge, a general approach to evaluate the impact of access control policies on the protected resources within NoSQL systems is still missing. In this paper, we start to fill this void, by proposing a data model agnostic approach, which, starting from schemaless datasets protected by different discretionary access control models, derives a view of the protected resources that points out authorized and unauthorized contents. Experimental results show the approach efficiency even with large datasets.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, due to the personal nature of the managed data, numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications represent a potential threat to user privacy. In order to address this issue, several access control models have been specifically designed for IoT. The great majority of these proposals adopt centralized enforcement mechanisms designed to control the communication of IoT devices operating in the same environment. However, these approaches cannot regulate data exchange operated by devices connected to different environments. To the best of our knowledge, effective approaches capable of controlling these forms of communications are still missing. Therefore, in this paper, we do a step to fill this void, by focusing on applications built on top of MQTT, a widely used protocol for IoT. We propose an access control framework to regulate data sharing across bridged MQTT environments, on the basis of both access control policies and user preferences. The proposed approach regulates data exchange among IoT devices belonging to interconnected environments by means of a decentralized enforcement mechanism. Experimental analyses show the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Recently, Personal Data Storage (PDS) has inaugurated a substantial change to the way people can store and control their personal data, by moving from a service-centric to a user-centric model. PDS offers individuals the capability to keep their data in a unique logical repository, that can be connected and exploited by proper analytical tools, or shared with third parties under the control of end users. Up to now, most of the research on PDS has focused on how to enforce user privacy preferences and how to secure data when stored into the PDS. In contrast, in this paper we aim at designing a Privacy-aware Personal Data Storage (P-PDS), that is, a PDS able to automatically take privacy-aware decisions on third parties access requests in accordance with user preferences. The proposed P-PDS is based on preliminary results presented in [1] , where it has been demonstrated that semi-supervised learning can be successfully exploited to make a PDS able to automatically decide whether an access request has to be authorized or not. In this paper, we have deeply revised the learning process in order to have a more usable P-PDS, in terms of reduced effort for the training phase, as well as a more conservative approach w.r.t. users privacy, when handling conflicting access requests. We run several experiments on a realistic dataset exploiting a group of 360 evaluators. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {Social networking platforms have become a popular way for Internet surfers to meet and interact. Twitter is one of the most popular social networking platforms where users can read the news, share ideas, discuss social issues, as well as stay in touch with friends and families. Due to its huge popularity, it has also become a target for spammers. Until now, researchers have developed many machine learning (ML) based methods for detecting spammers on Twitter. However, the available ML-based methods cannot efficiently detect spammers on Twitter due to possible data manipulations by spam users to avoid detection mechanisms. As an alternative to ML-based detection, in this paper, we present a new approach based on deep learning (DL) techniques. Our approach leverages both on tweet text as well as users’ meta-data (e.g., age of an account, number of followings/followers, and so on) to detect spammers. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with five ML-based and two DL-based state of the art approaches on two different real-world datasets, showing a gain in performance when using our approach.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Nowadays, organizations need to set higher and higher business goals in order to cope with market requirements. Indeed, a widespread strategy for organizations is to join in inter-organizational processes, which set collaborations and resource sharing among involved organizations. However, the possible lack of trust among the organizations poses relevant issues on the processing of sensitive resources. A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology. Thanks to its design and consensus algorithm, blockchain provides a trustworthy infrastructure that allows partners involved in the collaboration to monitor and perform audits on the workflow transitions. In general, the focus of the existing blockchain-based workflow management solutions is mainly workflow coordination. However, a challenging characteristic of some workflows is that they require the exchange of a big amount of data that has to be managed off-chain, that is, directly exchanged between data producer and consumer. This off-chain data sharing should be secured and controlled such to follow the workflow execution.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a controlled information sharing in inter-organizational workflows enforced via smart contracts. Smart contracts are designed to coordinate the workflow execution, as well as to deploy a set of authorizations granting access only to the task executor and only to those resources needed for task execution and only during the task activation. We have also run a set of experiments to show the feasibility of our approach.},

Rather than centralised airspace management (which is rapidly reaching capacity limits), those vehicles need to collaborate safely and efficiently. However, the vehicles differ significantly with respect to capabilities, carried equipment, and certification requirements. The main focus of this paper is how to determine a safe level of interaction in a heterogeneous network, where not all vehicles are (equally) trustworthy, but cooperation is required for many different reasons (e.g., collision avoidance, implementation of collaborative tasks). Consequently, this paper presents the main research challenges deriving from integrating UASs in a shared airspace, with a focus on the demanding scenario of urban air mobility. Specific use cases are described to highlight the main challenges and requirements for a security architecture. Furthermore, a roadmap is presented towards addressing the main challenges: trust estimation, interaction adaptation, controlled information sharing, and continuous monitoring and adaptation.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Today, users interact with a variety of online services offered by different providers. In order to supply their services, providers collect, store and process users' data according to their privacy policies. To have more control on personal data, user can specify a set of privacy preferences, encoding the conditions according to which his/her data can be used and managed by the provider. Moreover, many services are context dependent, that is, the type of delivered service is based on user contextual information (e.g., time, location, and so on). This makes more complicated the definition of privacy preferences, as, typically, users might have different attitude with respect the privacy management based on the current context (e.g., working hour, free time). To provide a more fine-grained control, a user can set up different privacy preferences for each different possible contexts. However, since user change the context very frequently, this might result in a very complex and time-consuming task. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a context-based privacy management service that helps users to manage their privacy preferences setting under different contexts. At this aim, we exploit machine learning algorithms to build a classifier, able to infer new privacy preferences for the new context. The preliminary experimental results we have conducted are promising, and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Social network providers anonymize graphs storing users' relationships to protect users from being re-identified. Despite the fact that most of the relationships are directed (e.g., follows), few works (e.g., the Paired-degree [1] and K-In&Out-Degree Anonymity [2]) have been designed to work with directed graphs. In this paper, we show that given a graph, DGA [1]and DSNDG-KIODA [2] are not always able to generate its anonymized version. We overcome this limitation by presenting the Cluster-based Directed Graph Anonymization Algorithm(CDGA) and prove that, by choosing the appropriate parameters, CDGA can generate an anonymized graph satisfying both the Paired k-degree [1] and K-In&Out-Degree Anonymity [2]. Also, we present the Out-and In-Degree Information Loss Metric to minimize the number of changes made to anonymize the graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-life data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of CDGA and compare the quality of the graphs anonymized by CDGA, DGA, and DSNDG-KIODA. The experimental results show that we can generate anonymized graphs, by modifying less than 0.007% of edges in the original graph.},

A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology and smart contracts to implement the overall discovery process deployment. However, due to the blockchain design, data within the blockchain is public and smart contracts cannot access data outside the blockchain, unless through the exploitation of Oracles. On the one hand, this brings benefits of trust decentralization, transparency, and accountability of the discovery process. On the other hand, it carries serious consequences on confidentiality and privacy as well as on Oracles trustworthiness. For these reasons, in this paper, we investigate how to ensure data confidentiality during the discovery process of IoT devices on blockchain even in the presence of an untrusted Oracle.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is now evolving into a loosely coupled, decentralized system of cooperating smart objects, where high-speed data processing, analytics and shorter response times are becoming more necessary than ever. Such decentralization has a great impact on the way personal information generated and consumed by smart objects should be protected, because, without centralized data management, it is more difficult to control how data are combined and used by smart objects. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework where users of smart objects can specify their privacy preferences. Compliance check of user individual privacy preferences is performed directly by smart objects. Moreover, acknowledging that embedding the enforcement mechanism into smart objects implies some overhead, we have extensively tested the proposed framework on different scenarios, and the obtained results show the feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Current popular and widely adopted Online Social Networks (OSNs) all follow a logically centered architecture, by which one single entity owns unprecedented collections of personal data in terms of amount, variety, geographical span, and richness in detail. This is clearly constituting one of the major threats to users privacy and to their right to be-left-alone. Decentralization has then been considered as the panacea to privacy issues, especially in the realms of OSNs. However, with a more thoughtful consideration of the issue, it could be argued that decentralization, if not designed and implemented carefully and properly, can have more serious implications on users privacy rather than bringing radical solutions. Moreover, research on Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) has shown that there are more challenges to their realization that need proper attention and more innovative technical solutions. In this paper, we discuss the issues related to privacy preservation between centralization and decentralization, and we provide a review of available research work on decentralized privacy preserving services for social networks.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Although the dramatic increase in Online Social Network (OSN) usage, there are still a lot of security and privacy concerns. In such a scenario, it would be very beneficial to have a mechanism able to assign a risk score to each OSN user. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a risk assessment based on the idea that the more a user behavior diverges from what it can be considered as a `normal behavior', the more it should be considered risky. In doing this, we have taken into account that OSN population is really heterogeneous in observed behaviors. As such, it is not possible to define a unique standard behavioral model that fits all OSN users' behaviors. However, we expect that similar people tend to follow similar rules with the results of similar behavioral models. For this reason, we propose a risk assessment approach organized into two phases: similar users are first grouped together, then, for each identified group, we build one or more models for normal behavior. The carried out experiments on a real Facebook dataset show that the proposed model outperforms a simplified behavioral-based risk assessment where behavioral models are built over the whole OSN population, without a group identification phase.},

The literature contains number of research works on these privacy concerns, each addressing them from a different focal point. We have explored the available literature on web services privacy during transactions, to present, in this paper, a thorough survey of the most relevant published proposals.

  abstract  = { Abstract:Social networks have become a popular way for internet surfers to interact with friends and family members, reading news, and also discuss events. Users spend more time on well-known social platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) storing and sharing their personal information. This information together with the opportunity of contacting thousands of users attract the interest of malicious users. They exploit the implicit trust relationships between users in order to achieve their malicious aims, for example, create malicious links within the posts/tweets, spread fake news, send out unsolicited messages to legitimate users, etc. In this paper, we investigate the nature of spam users on Twitter with the goal to improve existing spam detection mechanisms. For detecting Twitter spammers, we make use of several new features, which are more effective and robust than existing used features (e.g., number of followings/followers, etc.). We evaluated the proposed set of features by exploiting very popular machine learning classification algorithms, namely k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayesian (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost). The performance of these classifiers are evaluated and compared based on different evaluation metrics. We compared the performance of our proposed approach with four latest state of art approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed set of features gives better performance than existing state of art approaches.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:In general, a botnet is a collection of compromised internet computers, controlled by attackers for malicious purposes. To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBot-Catcher, then discussing its components.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Today, most of the services one may think of are based on a collaborative paradigm (e.g., social media services, IoT-based services, etc.). One of the most relevant representative of such class of services are inter-organizational processes, where an organized group of joined activities is carried out by two or more organizations to achieve a common business goal. Inter-organizational processes are therefore vital to achieve business partnerships among different organizations. However, they may also pose serious security and privacy threats to the data each organization exposes. This is mainly due to the weak trust relationships that may hold among the collaborating parties, which result in a potential lack of trust on how data/operations are managed. In this paper, we discuss, how blockchain, one of today hottest technology, can be used in support of secure inter-organizational processes. We further point out which additional security issues the use of blockchain can bring, illustrate the ongoing research projects in the area and discuss future research directions.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:One of the main issues in service collaborations among business partners is the possible lack of trust among them. A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology by encoding with smart contracts the business process workflow. This brings the benefits of trust decentralization, transparency, and accountability of the service composition process. However, data in the blockchain are public, implying thus serious consequences on confidentiality and privacy. Moreover, smart contracts can access data outside the blockchain only through Oracles, which might pose new confidentiality risks if no assumptions are made on their trustworthiness. For these reasons, in this paper, we are interested in investigating how to ensure data confidentiality during business process execution on blockchain even in the presence of an untrusted Oracle.},

		Confidentiality and privacy of data managed by IoT ecosystems is becoming a primary concern. This paper targets the design of a general access control enforcement mechanism for MQTT-based IoT ecosystems. The proposed approach is presented with ABAC, but other access control models can be similarly supported. The solution is based on an enforcement monitor that has been designed to operate as a proxy between MQTT clients and an MQTT server. The monitor enforces access control constraints by intercepting and possibly manipulating the flow of exchanged MQTT control packets. Early experimental evaluations have overall shown low enforcement overhead.

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is now evolving into a loosely coupled, decentralized system of cooperating smart objects, where high-speed data processing, analytics and shorter response times are becoming more necessary than ever. Such decentralization has a great impact on the way personal information generated and consumed by smart objects should be protected, because, without centralized data management, it is more difficult to control how data are combined and used by smart objects. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework where users of smart objects can specify their privacy preferences. Compliance check of user individual privacy preferences is performed directly by smart objects. Moreover, acknowledging that embedding the enforcement mechanism into smart objects implies some overhead, we have extensively tested the proposed framework on different scenarios, and the obtained results show the feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:In general, a botnet is a collection of compromised internet computers, controlled by attackers for malicious purposes. To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBot-Catcher, then discussing its components.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Privacy has become a key requirement for data management systems. Nevertheless, NoSQL datastores, namely highly scalable non relational database management systems, which often support data management of Internet scale applications,still do not provide support for privacy policies enforcement. With this work, we begin to address this issue, by proposing an approach for the integration of purpose based policy enforcement capabilities into MongoDB, a popular NoSQL datastore. Our contribution consists of the enhancement of the MongoDB role based access control model with privacy concepts and related enforcement monitor. The proposed monitor is easily integrable into any MongoDB deployment through simple configurations. Experimental results show that our monitor enforces purpose-based access control with low overhead.},

The PDS offers a unique logical repository, allowing individuals to collect, store, and give access to their data to third parties. The research on PDS has so far mainly focused on the enforcement mechanisms, that is, on how user privacy preferences can be enforced. In contrast, the fundamental issue of preference specification has been so far not deeply investigated. In this paper, we do a step in this direction by proposing different learning algorithms that allow a fine-grained learning of the privacy aptitudes of PDS owners. The learned models are then used to answer third party access requests. The extensive experiments we have performed show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:NoSQL datastores allow the efficient management of high volumes of heterogeneous and unstructured data, meeting the requirements of a variety of today ICT applications. However, most of these systems poorly support data security, and recent surveys show that their simplistic support for data protection is considered as a reason not to use them.1 In recent years, Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is getting more and more popularity, for its ability to provide highly flexible and customized forms of data protection at different granularity levels. In the current work, with the aim to raise users' confidence in the protection of data managed by NoSQL systems, we define a general approach to enforce ABAC within NoSQL systems. Our approach relies on SQL++[20], a unifying query language for NoSQL platforms. In particular, we develop a novel SQL++ query rewriting mechanism able to enforce heterogeneous types of ABAC policies specified up to cell level. Experimental results show an overhead which is not negligible for policies covering high percentage of the fields characterizing the protected documents, but which is far more contained when field level policies are more sparsely specified.},

However, despite all the benefits and the flexibility that OSNs provide, their users become more reliant on online identities with often no means to know who really is behind an online profile. Indeed, to facilitate their adoption and encourage people to join, identities in OSNs are very loose, in that not much more than an email address is required to create an account and related profile. Therefore, the problem of fake accounts and identity related attacks in OSNs has attracted considerable interest from the research community, and resulted in several proposals that mainly aim at detecting malicious nodes that follow identified and formalized attack trends. Without denying the importance of formalizing Sybil attacks and suggesting solutions for their detection, in this extended abstract we also consider the issue of identity validation from a user perspective, by briefly discussing the research proposals aiming at empowering users with tools helping them to identify the validity of the online accounts they interact with.On-line Social Networks (OSNs) have dramatically changed how users connect, communicate, share content, and exchange goods and services.

This fact boosts investments in mobile applications, among which are the person-to-person mobile payment applications. These applications are pretty sensitive in that they are related to monetary transactions, thus involving strict security and privacy requirements. To this purpose, we propose a secure protocol leveraging online social network connections to help users enforce their trust preferences locally to make a money transfer. The protocol exploits mobile ad-hoc network as a communication means. To improve the network performance by still preserving data security and user privacy, we also propose some optimization strategies to decrease the number of tokensets sent over mobile ad-hoc network.

However, due to the high volume of managed personal data, they can be a serious threat for individuals privacy. Users data are commonly gathered by devices scattered in the IoT, each of which sees a portion of them. The combination of different data may lead to infer users sensitive information. The distributed nature and the complexity of the IoT scenario cause users to lose the control on how their data are handled. In this paper, we start addressing this issue with a framework that empowers users to better control data management within IoT ecosystems. A novel privacy reference model allows users to state how their data can be processed and what cannot be inferred from them, and a dedicated mechanism allows enforcing the stated references. Experimental results show the efficiency of the enforcement.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Online Social Networks (OSNs) remain the focal point of Internet usage. Since the beginning, networking sites tried best to have right privacy mechanisms in place for users, enabling them to share the right content with the right audience. With all these efforts, privacy customizations remain hard for users across the sites. Existing research that address this problem mainly focus on semi-supervised strategies that introduce extra complexity by requiring the user to manually specify initial privacy preferences for their friends. In this work, we suggest an adaptive solution that can dynamically generate privacy labels for users in OSNs. To this end, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework that targets two key problems in OSNs like Facebook: the exposure of users' interactions through the network to less trusted direct friends, and the possibility of propagating user updates through direct friends' interactions to indirect friends. By implementing this framework, we aim at understanding how social trust and privacy could be correlated, specifically in a dynamic fashion. We report the ranked dependence between the generated privacy labels and the estimated user trust values, which indicate the ability of the framework to identify the highly trusted users and share with them higher percentages of data.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:In recent years Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC) has become the reference paradigm for controlled information sharing in Online Social Network (OSN) scenarios. Nevertheless, many of the most popular OSN providers do not implement in their platforms an access control model fully compliant with ReBAC. This fact, thus, limits the capability of OSN users to define customized and fine-grained access control policies. Moreover, average users might have difficulties in properly setting, potentially, complex access control policies. As results, many users give up in defining proper privacy setting, simply accepting the default setting proposed by OSN provider. To cope with this problem, we see the need of tools in support of policy specification. At this aim, in this paper we presenta recommendation system that, exploiting an association rules mining process, learns OSN users' habits in releasing resources in online social networks, and exploit them to suggest customized access control policies. We also prove the feasibility of the presented techniques by illustrating an experiment which has been conducted on 30 human users by building customized access control policies from the data learnt from each of them.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Many modern applications use context related information to provide highly personalized services, and use NoSQL databases for data management, as these systems show outstanding performance and support high volumes of data. However, NoSQL databases integrate poor data protection features with basic coarse grained access control and no support for context aware policies. Therefore, we believe that a general approach is required to enhance NoSQL datastores with fine grained context aware access control. In this paper, we start to fill this void by targeting MongoDB, a very popular datastore. The contribution is twofold. We enhance MongoDB's access control model with advanced features and we define an enforcement monitor for the proposed enhanced model, which can be straightforwardly used in any MongoDB deployment. Technological limitations of MongoDB do not allow implementing the same efficient enforcement mechanism for all query types. As a consequence, experimental results show an enforcement overhead that is significant for aggregate queries, which contrasts with a low overhead measured for find and map-reduce queries.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Fake accounts in online social networks (OSNs) have known considerable sophistication and are now attempting to gain network trust by infiltrating within honest communities. Honest users have limited perspective on the truthfulness of new online identities requesting their friendship. This facilitates the task of fake accounts in deceiving honest users to befriend them. To address this, we have proposed a model that learns hidden correlations between profile attributes within OSN communities, and exploits them to assist users in estimating the trustworthiness of new profiles. To demonstrate our method, we suggest, in this demo, a game application through which players try to cheat the system and convince nodes in a simulated OSN to befriend them. The game deploys different strategies to challenge the players and to reach the objectives of the demo. These objectives are to make participants aware of how fake accounts can infiltrate within their OSN communities, to demonstrate how our suggested method could aid in mitigating this threat, and to eventually strengthen our model based on the data collected from the moves of the players.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:The United States and its Allied Forces have had tremendous success in combat operations. This includes combat in Germany, Japan and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. However not all of our stabilization and reconstruction operations (SARO) have been as successful. Several studies have been carried out on SARO by organizations such as the National Defense University and the Naval Post Graduate School. These studies have shown that security as well as power and jobs are key ingredients for success during SARO. One of the major conclusions is that we need to plan for SARO while we are planning for combat. These studies have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully carrying out SARO which include sensors, robotics and information management. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships between the local communities as well as determine who the important people are. One particular task during SARO is managing emergencies and crisis situations as well as carrying out humanitarian operations. In such situations, it is critical that the information between various individuals as well as agencies be shared. Furthermore, social relationships between the different parties need to be analyzed. To address the key technical challenges for emergency management and crisis response during SARO and related humanitarian efforts we are exploring assured information sharing and secure social networking to develop novel technologies to support emergency management and crisis response.},

As such, PDS demands for new privacy models for protecting personal data. In this paper, we propose a new technical approach that empowers individuals to better control data in PDS. Particularly, we present a privacy-aware PDS architecture by focusing on two logical data zones based on the categories of personal data. Moreover, we propose a strategy for regulating personal data release that takes in consideration both user preferences and possible risks and benefits of the data release.},

For instance, it may be helpful for the identification of attackers or risky users in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Indeed, dynamically monitoring and learning the friendship patterns of users in a large social graph over time for any anomalous change often reflects and predicts significant events or attacker's behaviors. In this paper, we focus on anomalous changes that happen in the neighborhood of OSN users. Our main goal is to detect those users whose changes in the structure of their subgraph deviate from their own previous change patterns and from those of other nearest users in the graph. Our approach returns a list of these users by ranking them based on the value of their change deviation. We analyze the performance of our approach on a real Google+ dataset.},

We define a language for specifying filtering policies suitable for Twitter posts. The language allows each user to decide which posts to filter out based on his/her sensibility and preferences. Since average users may not have the skills necessary to translate their filtering needs into a set of rules, we also propose a method for inferring a policy automatically, based solely on examples of the desired filtering behavior. The method is based on an evolutionary approach driven by a multi-objective optimization scheme. We assess our proposal experimentally on a real Twitter dataset and the results are highly promising.},

  abstract  = {Big Data is an emerging phenomenon that is rapidly changing business models and work styles [1]. Big Data platforms allow the storage and analysis of high volumes of data with heterogeneous format from different sources. This integrated analysis allows the derivation of properties and correlations among data that can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as making predictions that can profitably affect decision processes. As a matter of fact, nowadays Big Data analytics are generally considered an asset for making business decisions. Big Data platforms have been specifically designed to support advanced form of analytics satisfying strict performance and scalability requirements. However, no proper consideration has been devoted so far to data protection. Indeed, although the analyzed data often include personal and sensitive information, with relevant threats to privacy implied by the analysis, so far Big Data platforms integrate quite basic form of access control, and no support for privacy policies. Although the potential benefits of data analysis are manifold, the lack of proper data protection mechanisms may prevent the adoption of Big Data analytics by several companies. This motivates the fundamental need to integrate privacy and security awareness into Big Data platforms. In this paper, we do a first step to achieve this ambitious goal, discussing research issues related to the definition of a framework that supports the integration of privacy aware access control features into existing Big Data platforms.},

We believe that DBMSs could greatly take benefit from the integration of an enhanced purpose based model supporting highly customized and efficient access control. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a purpose-based model that supports action-aware policy specification and a related efficient enforcement framework to be integrated into relational DBMSs. The experimental evaluation we have performed shows the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Online Social Networks exploit a lightweight process to identify their users so as to facilitate their fast adoption. However, such convenience comes at the price of making legitimate users subject to different threats created by fake accounts. Therefore, there is a crucial need to empower users with tools helping them in assigning a level of trust to whomever they interact with. To cope with this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel model, DIVa, that leverages on mining techniques to find correlations among user profile attributes. These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50% than the global approach.},

  abstract  = {Executing data analytics tasks in MapReduce systems introduces new security and privacy concerns as the processed unstructured datasets may contain sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers, business sensitive information) at the level of individual records, and the existing file-level access control mechanisms provide all or nothing access to the entire dataset. To address these concerns, we propose GUARDMR which is a novel, modular framework that can enforce fine-grained security policies at the key-value level in MapReduce systems. The presented security policies can dynamically create authorized views of data resources based on the organizational roles of the MapReduce users. GUARDMR further simplifies the specification of authorized views via automatically generating the bytecode of the functions necessary for creating the views, from the high level specification language (i.e., OCL). It facilitates enforcement of a broad, flexible set of policies that can handle the complexity demanded by high volume, high variety, unstructured datasets and general MapReduce computation without any modification to the underlying MapReduce system and operating system. Our evaluation results indicate that GUARDMR provides fine-grained access control for Apache Hadoop system with easy maintainability and very low overhead.},

So far this problem has been investigated in the setting of orchestrated service composition, under the assumption of the presence of a broker coordinating the composition. However, a promising alternative approach is the one of choreography, where each service involved in the service composition has to locally manage service selection and invocation. In this paper, we propose a framework to enforce user and provider requirements in the scenario of service choreography in a privacy-preserving way, that is, without the releasing of any private information of users and providers.

As death is unquestionably a crucial and fundamental part of life, technology and the digital world ought to play an equally important role in end of life issues as well. For instance, the adoption of online social networks (OSNs) has been amplifying to cover large numbers of the world's population playing big roles in shaping their daily life, in documenting their life experiences, and in sharing their moments with their friends in the network. While current systems focus on the provision of usable and attractive features of their OSN services, considerations of the faith of the online accounts, identities, and data created and shared in their realms when the owner is mo more available to manage them have not been equally taken. In this paper, we raise and discuss issues related to the design and to the provision of integrated services for a posthumous data management that would respect the wills of users all while being concealed to their survivors. We survey the existing practices, we discuss their limitations, and we suggest an integrated approach to posthumous data management based on posthumous data planning assisted by data categorization and automated tools.},

MAPaS supports the specification of purpose and role-based access control policies that regulate the access to data based on purpose compliance, role and purpose-based authorisations. The current version of MAPaS allows the definition of the scheme of the database whose data must be protected and the SQL queries that should be executed on such a database. A rich analysis toolkit allows user to assess the compliance of these queries with the specified privacy policies. The analysis can be done even before the database is populated. The use of MAPaS bring users to define SQL queries which are privacy aware by design.},

  abstract  = { Abstract:Within Database Management Systems (DBMS), privacy policies regulate the collection, access and disclosure of the stored personal, identifiable and sensitive data. Policies often specify obligations which represent actions that must be executed or conditions that must be satisfied before and/or after data are accessed. Although numerous policies specification languages allow the specification, no systematic support is provided to enforce obligations within relational DBMS. In this paper, we make a step to fill this void presenting an approach to the definition of an enforcement monitor which handles privacy policies that include obligations. Such a monitor is derived from the same set of policies that must be enforced, and regulates the execution of SQL code based on the satisfaction of a variety of obligation types. The proposed solution is systematic, has been automated, does not require any programming activity and can be used with most of the existing relational DBMSs.},

Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users.},

  abstract  = {Privacy is becoming a key requirement for ICT applications that handle personal data. However, Database Management Systems (DBMSs), which are devoted to data collection and processing by definition, still do not provide the proper support for privacy policies. Policies are enforced by ad-hoc programmed software modules that complement DBMS access control services. This practice is time consuming, error prone, and neither general nor scalable. This work does a first step to overcome these limits. We propose a systematic approach to the automatic development of a monitor that regulates the execution of SQL queries based on purpose based privacy policies. The proposed solution does not require programming, it is general, platform independent and usable with most of the existing relational DBMSs.},

In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised knowledge-based classifier for short text messages, where each category is represented by an ego-network. 
A short text is classified into a category depending on how far its words are from the ego of that category. We show how this technique can be used both in single label and in multi-label classification, and how it outperforms the state of the art for short text messages classification.},

Literature offers several proposals addressing issues related to identity breaches and/or identity related attacks on OSNs, but only a few aim at giving means to judge users' reliability in terms of trustworthiness of their claimed identities. In this paper, we propose an identity validation process that relies on OSN community feedback to assign to OSN users identity trustworthiness levels. For this purpose, we define a community based supervised learning process to detect the set of attributes in a user profile for which it is expected to see a correlation among their values (e.g., job and salary). Once these correlated attribute sets are identified, the profile of a target user is judged by a selected group of raters to estimate her identity trustworthiness level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal through experimentation under two different scenarios and using real data. The experiments' results under the two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and meaningfulness of our proposal.},

A way to coordinate this cooperation is orchestration, which implies that the workflow underlying the composite web service is processed by a broker hosting a workflow engine (e.g., BPEL engine). According to the orchestration paradigm, the broker coordinates the invocation of services involved in the composition by passing the needed parameters. In general, all previous proposals for the service orchestration model consider the broker as a trusted entity. As such, they never payed attention to the fact that the broker is able to access several pieces of sensitive data. We believe there is the need to protect them against improper access and usage from partner services as well as the broker. To cope with these issues, in this paper, we propose a protocol based on a selective encryption able to ensure that both the broker and service partners can access only the information needed to fulfill their activities.Composite web services are usually coordinated according to a workflow, composed by several activities, each of which carried out by a service.
