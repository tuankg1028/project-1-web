it is useful to our phone privacy it makes you give all permission not even a bit of privacy fix it please this seem so to be an incomplete app dysfunctional without a direct connection and security risk to facebook not worth the risk very functional for making notes on the fly love the ability to add a privacy pin and sync between devices too distracting for kids usually i have to brush the teeth while my daughter play with that app and permanently open some sort of presents play with the app and brush the teeth properly is likely impossible i think the app missed the purpose i will give the app some additional tries before uninstalling - the first impression is awful additionally the toothbrush app for kids is a privacy nightmare needs permission to camera contacts location phone calls microphone and storage for what cannot pair the brush properly i have a lot bluetooth devices i m sure that i m know what i m do but it not work my child was distraught because this app stopped working have now realised that it required additional permissions which i have refused and don t see why you need why should you be recording children and or their parents it s bad enough that it needs bluetooth and location although i understand why but to be recording too how many security vulnerabilities do you want around your kids twice daily routines overall one of the most important apps on my phone however there s a major security concern first of all in order to enter the editor it needs location access why what if i just need a widget with a clock or a battery level why does it need a location and i will tell you why because even if you don t use weather it will still periodically get your location submit it somewhere and get the weather check the app data usage and this is regardless of what widget you have even if it s only a battery voltage workaround open kwgt give it all the permissions so you can work make your widget close the app go to settings remove all permissions storage and calendar may be left though and restrict from data usage negative stars would be given if possible do not use this app safety security is awful within an hour of starting to use the app got a google notification another device had accessed my account as if that isn t bad enough you can send a message to someone who has a listing you re interested in but you can t access the reply unless you pay i ll stick with craigslist great privacy with this browser loving it unusable can t use it on a tablet does not work on wifi must be connected to internet via 4g can t login to tel tra account as keep getting turn off private mode error message i m not in private mode and what business does scumbag telstra have telling me how to browse the web anyway typical over permissioned app that just never stops wanting to breach my privacy and suck private information out of you deleted and moving from boost google duo keeps crashing there was too many ads and the security was insufficient i thnk its a very wonderful app for us who wants to make sure our privacy its olay junk main purpose seems to get you to accept their spam and automated billing their network troubleshooting is a invasion of your privacy as it requires their router and logs into it this would grant them access to anything on your network there s more to network diagnostics then router configurations and should warn users before attempting anything this intrusive do not download if you have clear all stored data uninstall change all important passwords immediately their privacy policy is legit they tell you in long boring lawyer speech that they are intentionally selling your data to countries outside of the european union they re not developers they re lazy criminals and there are tens of thousands of apps just like this in the play store always always always check the devs and report the criminals- clearly google isn t doin anything its cool biz app but security of transaction unknown they require unnecessary permission to view anything the permission is to know your number your service provider and more information to keep spying on you keep in mind that this is an im app not phone calling or video conferencing app they are clearly violating the users privacy security compromised it doesn t log you out automatically when you close the app next time when you open the app you ll already be logged in it s a serious security concern if you forget to log out someday the app to secure your passwords is not secured itself disappointing serious privacy concerns updated june 2021 - issue needs addressing immediately the app wouldn t let me view my text messages via my pc unless i gave full permissions for the app to see my call log and to make calls on my phone - a totally unrelated permission to text messaging we should not have to grant all permissions in order to use unrelated features on the app this is surely a matter of concern for our privacy be wary using this app so many things wrong with this app and services let me start and i get the developers are going to be very upset with what is going to be laid out 1 it s blatant violation of privacy all the info is stored and sold off from a database to other partner websites 2 approval is based on the decision of some guy entity in an office somewhere not only do they steal your info but they deny you registeration based on absolutely nothing 3 many of the so called member s are fake accounts requires access to entire device folders instead of giving the option to only give access to a specific golder such as other music player apps massive security risk in what is otherwise a cool app update the storage permissions and happy to buy premium and rate 5 because it s just what i m looking for do not use this app it totally violates your privacy security without warning there is a basic interface with a few functions one of which unexpectedly launches a full instance of the pc version of gimp on a server sending your image there worse this server reuses guest accounts so not only does the server admin have access to your stuff so do other random people only upside is that the data usage suggests that it only sends the selected image and not everything on your phone this app is pretty novel but the author does not adequately explain how it works gimp is not run locally - it is run on the author s private server in the cloud via vnc and any image you open gets uploaded to him this also uses a lot of bandwidth without warning the user i would give 5 stars if this was communicated but i value privacy and security too much to give any higher rating than this let me use the app without forcing me to share my oral care data with you it lets me select maybe later then forces me back to the screen not letting me progress so i can update firmware how many people unhappily gave you their data unacceptable violation of privacy unacceptable business practices right i made my point i don t want to download some crapy application that needs to violate my privacy just because it says i might have viruses i am not ignorant to how to remove viruses from any phone or computer i don t trust your application do to advertising fauls applications that ask for full promitions to my phone i am uninstalling your application thanks but no thanks i didn t even get through to the main app as it has mandatory facebook integration i can understand the need for personal details but compulsory collection of all likes photos friends list just to log in no thank you substantial privacy concerns and very unreasonable information requirements security risk when we input our credentials inside other app why can t u allow download with just the video url mostly works it is a little bit goofy and doesn t stay working for long before you have to restart the process and pair your phone with your laptop but it s not typically more than once a week so it s not a dealbreaker seems like they re a bit overly vigilant about security many of us live alone and nobody touches our devices ever -- yeah i know boohoo also the qr code thing almost never works but the solution to that is to know your passwords i also use pulse to do sms via pc and don t have these same pairing issues and pulse has a great rep security wise but whatever i still like the app it s free doesn t have ads that i ve noticed and doesn t glom a ton of resources and if you have two phones with two different numbers you can combine it with the pulse app or some other mobile to pc app to access two different numbers on your pc kh ng th t t tr l o app persistently force user to enable permission to display over other apps a privacy concern annoying and intrusive the app transfers private data name pregnancy week email to third parties without consent privacy policy doesn t allow that only data for processing on behalf of mom life or usage by mom life itself i am frustrated and am going to take legal action very good app fairly easy to use the company behind it can at times have less than ideal practices such as agressive online tracking and advertising but people who are a little privacy focused can easily adjust that so i use it with pleasure developers please read this app is absolutely amazing without it i would be completely disorganized i am able to keep all my important information documents notes and reminders in one place and not have to worry about privacy there are two things i wish you would incorporate wether premium feature or free - 1 having the option to chose which screen the app opens to folders all notes or reminders 2 being able to upload and view pdf files without file being converted to text setup process went great as compared to my first try no more having to rely on third party applications for notification mirroring and sms makes me feel uncomfortable when sentences have typos privacy policy is questionable it s a calendar app why do you need targeting information then i see an ad at the top nope not today satan you should visit browsergood com to download and install browser the best app it s fast my fav browser for 2019 so far everything is awesome about this browser much faster better privacy than some of the other bigger names the only way to know if u like anything is to try it first i like the ease of use update i couldn t find it in settings a way to add another search engine to the top feed where we can switch by swiping it doesn t let me add one that isn t already listed terrible crashes constantly the full editor isn t even local it s a connection to a vm running an outdated copy of gimp so plenty of security issues here too further it s annoying to have the full-blown software dangled in your face only to find it s a basic photo editor with the same cripplingly anemic set of tools every other selfie app has oh and don t forget the ads running on what is normally free and open source software would rate zero stars if i could pathetic be aware of this app it is accessing to copy all my financial information every time i do my online payments for any other apps also many ads is annoying me privacy nightmare hacker dream with very real security repercussions as it adds even more ways for your devices to be compromised accessed remotely monitored etc there are plenty of apps not requiring full access to entire computers networks drives settings but instead will sync and allow access only to selected folders drives apps etc based on more secure parameters you can set i m trying to remove these apps and its connections which has been slow frustrating don t do it people wants my email and verification before i can see the app there is no privacy policy mentioned no thanks this app asks for completely unnecessary facebook permissions i don t see why it needs to know my likes friends list and photos completely not worth the intrusion of your privacy stay clear beware of this site they will try to steal your cc information i placed an order from them and after 3 days my order was still being prepared i reached out to them since they didn t bother to communicate with me and spoke to a very unhelpful and unsympathetic csr who told me that there is an issue and that i need to verify my cc by sending them a photo of my cc front and back exposing the cc s security code csr added that it is jollychic s policy and im not into their policy cancelled no mention of security for data synchronisation will google be able to read all my data or synchronised notes must provide method to export csv and extract data from app otherwise useless like others not offering free export import or limitation of 1 backup per week month where is the security in this app anybody with my flying club number and my name can log in and use it why not a password like the website awful setup is atrocious permissions are intrusive has multiple ways of linking but none work appears that if you don t give microsoft the keys to the castle with full permission to all the data they want the setup hangs at the final step truly awful i should have expected this - i mean it s microsoft the devil behind the w10 privacy nightmare huge privacy issue remote editor has everyone elses stuff on it which can be accessed by anyone using the remote editor could not open my files but they are probably on the server now as one of the guests huge privacy issue and quite frankly i am irate asks for too much permissions only reason they need phonecall permission is to spy on your imei number don t install this garbage unless there s a gun pointed at your head nay there is no situation that you should use any of this company s android apps privacy alert uninstalled this was a great app i ve had it for over a year but the latest update is huge breach of trust you can now only use the app while being registered they would like you to use facebook or an email address for an app the tracks your phone usage what apps you use and for how long this mandatory registration is unacceptable the worst invasion of privacy they force you to sign in only with your facebook profile and then take all your personal information very private stuff and add it to your listing i was looking for a room to rent i paid their membership fee and i had to cancel it because i couldn t get my facebook info off my ad for needing a room i hate this app and their supprt does not reply to anything do not waste your money unless you want your pvt info to be blasted this app is a clipboard snooper the new version of android implements a security feature that notifies you when an application accesses the contents of your clipboard almost every time i start this app i get a pop-up stating that krazy coupon lady pasted from your clipboard there is absolutely no legit reason for this to be happening and it s not trustworthy app behaviour eta clipboard access does not require any special permissions to be granted as it s a basic os function the issue is that it s being accessed on startup unexpectedly and unnecessarily i d paste a screenshot if i could but anyone running android 12 will see the same notification that their clipboard has been accessed i m not arguing that this app is necessarily misusing this feature but as i have no way of knowing what it s doing with my data i cannot trust it abysmal security browsing the xgimp file system i can t find my own projects among the hundreds of guest folders folders which i assume every user has unlimited access to which means the two files i edited online ale also out there for everyone can t seem to find a way to delete anything off the shared filesystem either lastest update leaves this app useless unless you give access to new privacy intrusions headphones worked fine without location but now you cant use them unless given full privacy access this app is not and has never been built-in or do you posses time travel equipment microsoft my phone was released before this app was released whoops caught red-handed in an outright lie i have documented the installation date and time and have a sweet video of microsoft hacking through my cell phone security systems illegally breaching my device to install their non-built-in malware how are you going to justify this obvious and 100 illegal intrusion into my personal property ms the app breaks if you don t give it gps permissions which is bad privacy practice i should be able to manually type in my location but when i do so it only gives me an error screen it s the easiest way to catch uninstall apps i ve found workout rooting idk why google took that option away but they need to bring it back i understand the needed for security but a secure phone shouldn t prevent me from controlling my own phone is but yes useful app for sure all people yawning here about is that app not works nobody is concerned about privacy this app literaly can read and controll anything that is going on your screen permissions you where giving are 1 read all screen content and controll screen 2 learn your behaviour and automate actions thats what my phone said when i tryed to give it permissions no thanks nobody will read my screen content or learn my behaviour i never tryed app so i dont know if it s working or not excellent for smart home use and you retain some privacy i tried this app and it is really good functionality and concept-wise however my deal breaker is the absence of client-side encryption right now a staff member from workflowy hacker who has access to servers can read my notes that is a huge no-no from privacy perspective another bad thing is that my data might be used for advertising even when i ve paid for the premium due to this i m only going to use this app once client-side encryption is added it is one of the best smart locks to help get your privacy protected i encourage many to try it i gave it this site a 5 star to draw attention to the fat that the people seeking a roommate are not always trust worthy people give false data do not show up or there is no name and on the door bell and they want high amount security deposit why would you require a thousand deposit and its a monthly to month a lease for a month why would i put down a grand sign a lease and then up and move again and then where is my grand do i have to go to small claims court to get it back and how long will that take this web site send up to many red flags for me and why are people that use this site so secretive i think i ll go back to craigslist truth be told it s only a one star good luck d w this app sold me fraudulent tickets i got to the concert and found they had sold my seats twice to get in i had to restart the app which then downloaded over 3 gig of my data and forced another login which help here to enable it to steal personal data causing what looked like a major security breach avoid this app at all costs just got the hookup on this phone to desktop theme it s full of possibilities i would lobe to explore so glad to get to see what i have been missing i usually use a social app for this but i regret not having tenacity in photos for many uses got to try it the voice of the incoming call callee is quite weak and not clear at all moreover it records only when kept in speakerphone mode which is a breach of privacy why do all alibaba apps require permissions to access unnecessary yet private phone data for users to just buy things on the portal this is ridiculous breach of personal privacy but i guess mainland chinese dont care for their privacy rights it good application with no ads the play back only sort of works clearly when speaker phone is on otherwise it sounds like a mouse speaking in the distance all the recorders seem to have the same problem that i have tried with some adjustments this could be the best automatic recorder on play store only if it could record clearly without speaker phone on developers please give this attention and you will have a winner privacy is also very important while speaking i see no improvements yet protect your privacy lock apps pictures first applock with fingerprint protect your privacy the first app lock with fingerprint support applock is an applocker app protector that will lock and protect apps using a password or pattern and fingerprint applock can lock social media apps messaging apps gallery contacts settings and any app you want prevent unauthorized access and protect your privacy with applocker never worry about friends borrow your phone to use mobi excellent app for privacy user friendly and has great features recommend to use it for smooth navigation huge privacy concern even during the app setup it needs location data to finish setup i mean why why a toothbrush app needs to know my location why philips tracks my location just to brush my teeth also if i do not share lots of my brushing data it would not let me finish the app setup even though it has a maybe later option but that option just kills the setup process why can t some of the private data saved locally on phone i will give the app a couple of tries and if i do not like it i will just uninstall it cool app but 1 privacy issue i see in it whenever i open my pc its just connect my phone i cant turn off sync so if i am going out and my lappy is at home anybody opens my lappy get to know where i am where i am spending money through sms notificatin which picture i am clicking what photos i am reciving its horrible to think all this you people need to fix this only app that gives an air index forecast and it s as reliable as most weather forecasts i like the simplicity and ease of navigating across the various menu options a quick scan of yet not a deep dive into the privacy policy looked acceptable i m gonna keep it check w me in fifteen minutes hours days et cetera more is often revealed in time 8 cheating they take personal data and refuse you to login until approval and you can t even see the privacy policy i wouldn t have downloaded if i knew i have to receive some approval before i can login and see what is inside should have the option to add extra fields and the ability to name them as some accounts have security questions and backup codes which obviously would be helpful to be able to save them as well like passwords instead of having to place them in the notes section in a rather unorganized manner this app is brought to you by the same social security irs and credit card scammers from the most corupt country on earth india avoid at all cost google should be ashamed of themselves for even having this garbage in the play store to begin with very invasive intrusive app you can only log in with facebook and the app pulls all your private info from your facebook that you would normally share with your close friends and displays it on your roomster profile for all to see this is a gross breach of privacy i would advise others not to use this app waste a lot of data to see unused adversities this app will steal all of your passwords photos and bill you over 200 don t download it if you value your privacy and phone it s a complete piece of junk anyway they have predatory billing practices to try to take advantage of people who aren t paying attention this app is a virus theres some type of security issue here ive went to the desktop version in the app trying to locate my image so trying to locate where is it on my phone downloaded through app i ended up elsewhere in the guest folder that has other persons pics selfies logos etc and other unrecognizable folder i ve used this through the website before and liked and so i downloaded the app i ve got too many questions are these yours other app users pics are mine visible to others too i m uninstalling it appears that they are running gimp on a cloud based instance of ubuntu so what this app really is is a remote connection to another machine running in the cloud seems like there could be a security issue here as we don t want out files uploaded to a machine run by a total stranger now there are ads in the app but is the income really enough to pay the bill for the cloud server who would buy cloud time without extracting some income stream somewhere for example can i work on a gigabyte sized nasa image there its a very nice app it works very smothly it do not contains ads please download it for your security i loved this app but please give one star only because it a very nice the app works fine now and is very useful but it has a huge flaw there is no way to secure the app if someone has access to your computer they can see all the data and everything you are doing on your phone you need to have a proximity sensor bt nfc that locks the connection when you are away from your computer or some kind of password or other security feature as it is this app is a security nightmare privacy invasive takes up tons of space required if you want to chat with people over fb also the new social platform selection screen is clunky cumbersome and not very responsive don t use the app don t sign up for it this company has been breached twice and all of my accounts have been compromised that makes it clear that these passwords are not encrypted like the should be when stored and the company does not have a sense of security i have tried multiple times to reach out on the website but no links work i had to download the app to get the proper email i m on my way of deleting the account associated and after this review the app way better than tiktok got this cause of it has better security and i been loving it ever since i love the flawless automatic video editor and the customizable video lengths video sorting could be better tho as shared by others suspicious behavior observed with this app i denied all permissions i think it would not need and the app still managed to run now i am getting crash reports multiple times a day whenever this app tries to snoop around even when i dont use it i dont mind the crash reports but this just goes to show how invasive this app is this app uses branch marketing services bnc lt which is a violation of everyone s privacy go into the options dig a little deeper and look around it s recording all of your usage and sending it back to companies to utilize at their convenience open your eyes gallery lock is fantastic with privacy protection easy to hide images and video clips and other document files i really like this app it connects and plays as soon as i get in my car it sounds so much better than other music apps that i have downloaded on my phone recently i received a privacy alert from my anti virus stating that this app was sending some of my information to facebook not good at all what happened to the shuffle and repeat icons bad doesnt adverise that you must use internally created images mp4 wants too much phone access actual functionality was dodgy on function security and principle this app at this version should not be used pretty good music app use to use audify music player and it breached privacy concerns so far this app is going great with no privacy issues would give 5 star but it jumbles up my music so a little hard to find a specific song but overall great music app well i must say i got disapointed at 1st but they really did action about it this is the kind of application where you can buy online and relax with safety and security and the stuff and management will try to do there best to solve your issue when it works it is a brilliant little app but over the last few days it has been hit miss on connecting and today 28th it has been down all day absolute nightmare accessing any sites as all my passwords are complex and stored here note to self keep a back up list somewhere although that does rather undermine the security quick simple non intrusive samsung inter beta with s search and duckduckgo is a must for private quick searches not a google far better google no privacy over run by ads share open mind set great for shoppers and victims to trade private info google has so many pop ups claiming to be the best all around simply put coning you to allowing you to approve them to invade your every waking moment with every push of a button that s why every add feels like their mindreaders okagoogleakaspy terrible experience bad ux sluggish performance asks for every permission under the sun dubious privacy policy and slows down your phone even if it is a brand new flagship just use the desktop site no good will come of using this app terrible experience bad ux sluggish performance asks for every permission under the sun dubious privacy policy and slows down your phone even if it is a brand new flagship just use the desktop site no good will come of using this app i don t know vietnamese but still really easy to navigate if you use google translate to register you have to put phone number they ll send code via sms then put last 4 digits of social security number then password and confirmation you can just scan refill cards choose new plans to top up see your balance etc gave 4 stars because takes up a lot of space on my phone and lots of unnecessary stuff like advertisements i downloaded the app so that i could disable the extremely annoying google assistant notification that goes off every time i accidentally touch the left headphone i wasn t able to access the app without consenting to a very troubling privacy agreement so i have not even opened it really disappointing well that was a waste of time only a handful of headsets are compatible with this app and the endurancerunbt is not one of them so i guess this is just a waste of space more than the privacy questions of a headphone app that needs to know the location of me ok folks this is one app that you will want to definitely read the privacy policy before putting your information in this is app is not affiliated with immigration they are personal data collectors that sell your info to third parties requires too much personal data privacy invasion i don t like having to agree to a privacy policy for such an app especial one that stresses no sign-up if you need such a policy your app isn t truly private someone add on my facebook feed to drive with via so i went ahead and applied thinking this was similar to uber and lyft i went ahead and provided all the information needed in order to become a driver for them including my social security number for the background check couple days later i get an email from them telling me sorry we can t help you because the drive is only good in three cities in the country hey here s a way to avoid getting people signing up who are not eligible ask are you a resident of one of these three states otherwise they re just stealing people s identities helpful tool to connect securely to your microsoft os don t use third-party apps it s more than what i wanted the most awesome gallery design i have ever encountered it has good level of security and privacy it s really an entertaining app phone and computer issues since icon disappeared from computer can t print emails from phone anymore either i didn t change anything print function stopped working after i synced devices this messed stuff up tried to uninstall app to resolve issues and phone won t let me hit uninstall and it asks to update side note this feels like i gave access to my phone and can t take my privacy back got all my pics and docs off of my cell and saved to my computer hard drive easy backup and transfer quick as well new app jumps around as i m reading due to pop up s and ads loading making it difficult to read news it s basically not a simple app anymore also i can no longer share a story with a simple link the app requires full 3rd party access to my contacts which i won t allow for obvious privacy reasons i like news 9 but i ll probably be moving away from this app until it become easy to use again with 23 built in trackers to track your life to very fine details this is one of the worst apps for privacy in play store the app can run automatically recognize activities and send data to various companies anytime it wants brilliant app free to place ads and good messaging app built for interactoon between buyers and sellers also their kyc and due diligence provides security for transactions on the platform this 60mb app to use with your toothbrush still requires gps permissions along with calendar why contacts why location phone storage and other why does a toothbrush app need to invade so much of my privacy called tech support and and asked why rolanda told me that it is required for the feature of mailing you new brush heads if you buy them from philips i asked if they would ask for my shipping address during checkout and she said yes so they don t need gps permissions right my toothbrush or toothbrush app does not need gps i will never allow a toothbrush to access gps ever how ridiculous philips you need to remove the gps requirement from your app when you click on the button that looks like the app s logo it takes you to a desktop style setting with the tagline the gay cannot use this program wish i could add a screenshot there is no way this is by the actual people who made gimp questionable security too sign up requires me to click through month after month to give my date of birth which is an invasion of privacy all for a simple app what kind of information do you really need won t use the app unistalling now i have no use for it uninstalled and unchecked the automatic update box quit force downloading things to my phone that i dont want or need you are in violation of my privacy remove it from my list now everyone knows you have that ability why do you need to know my location when i m using my headphones invading of privacy deleting app update emailed support developers and asked why they needed the location permission they didn t even bother to answer that s now almost three weeks ago very sleek performance the sharing setting is a bit hassle since u have to change it everytime to enable others to view your slide but it does protect privacy so it s okay i just wish there s a default setting we can set i like that i can have it to where i have to use a password or number code to get on it so i don t have to worry about someone reading my notes if i m not mistaken i think you can use a pattern for security as well it s super easy to use and my favorite part is that i can make each note a different color nice colors too would definitely recommend the only gimp here is the dev who thought using vnc to connect to a computer under a shared user profile was a good idea for an app that may house sensitive documents you can literally get onto the desktop of the machine by complete accident and view other users files lost for words people stay well away from this massive data security risk this app require that you use facebook to login and amongst the facebook permissions that can not be unchecked is photos and list of friends yes this is even before you have begun browsing the posts this is a complete and shameful rape of privacy something we would never accept in the real world i am a customer and would like to be seen as a human with dignity my first impression of this app even before using it is that they do not see me as such absolutely love the ability to send sms from my pc without having to constantly unlock and lock my device for each sms i receive could do a bit better with security though take a page out of googles playbook with there messages app it makes you scan a qr code to authenticate each device i like this so not just anyone can open an app and control of my device excellent app very efficient and user friend above all its fast and reliable no issue insecurity in uploading your personal data becuase its safe here essential app i love this app this app give me more privacy have some little problems which are - 1 tax deduction menu style if difficult to handle 2 forms download 3 maximum mobile are showing or messaging where security antivirus app are exist in mobile - privacy risk about this app downloading 4 need to update this app otherwise this app is very nice your privacy policy says the app won t ask for my location yet without allowing it to locate my device i m unable to access it the internet gives as much as my ip address so far as my data is turned on so why do i need to allow the app to locate my device before i can even access it it s better than ever--it s less likely to crash now it has freed me from cable tv however i don t understand why i have to enable my location unless i want to watch a local channel as a result i can t watch with my wifi privacy app because the latter uses a vpn the cloud dvr is very good and i use it all the time i wouldn t mind more space for recordings for free i have a samsung galaxy note 5 a roku device comcast wifi and t-mobile this has too many ads and is a privacy invader don t download it it doesn t even work not useful while previously free features now require a subscription i recommend global entry as an alternative that is about 25 more per year but also includes precheck additionally in all cases i have used the app customs funneled all passengers into a single line once baggage was claimed negating the time savings achieved edit to clarify paid features didn t justify the cost security privacy best practice is to store personal info on device and encrypted very good private notepad with security features loving it it s running in the background collecting personal data and it cannot be stopped once it is manually closed it automatically start again jodel requires google location accuracy be turned on in order to use the app why is gps not enough it also requires phone permissions before you can even make an account presumably because it would rather violate users privacy than trust them to type in their own text confirmation code i wanted to hear the latest buzz around my company but unfortunately i had to uninstall due to the unreasonable permission requests it appears you can t opt out of providing them your private information e g brushing times whatever - and their privacy notoce says that they will sharebyour data with others for as long as they want and how they want maybe i am missing something privacy at risk read privacy notes car efully intel can share personal information to it s third party services n to govt authorities so judge it is it truly safe to store back card s n password here privacy issue - why u need access to my contacts and why system messages r only in chinese privacy issue - why u need access to my contacts and why system messages r only in chinese i would recommend reading the entire terms of use privacy and your contents part of the agreement by using this app you are giving them complete control of all of your settings contacts and all history and content to use share edit or even permanently delete at their discretion i can t imagine anyone thinking that is at all necessary or acceptable i suspect most people are unaware of everything that they are agreeing to by downloading and using this app couldn t post without giving 1 star sling uses ad choice to run commercials on this app which means it collects data as well and sells it to big corporations like oracle google has a class action on them for after opt-out option is applied they still continue to track your privacy there will be a time where people will stop using cell phones also the best at anytime you ll receive 720p resolution pay for what you get at best this is the type of convergence i was expecting from microsoft both samsung and microsoft have done a great job continue the great work and keep improving the product i would also expect samsung to respect our privacy a little bit more the search depth is vary good the only thing i don t like is the third party advertising companies who also track my searches and target me to sell my data effective privacy issues are convoluted enough to be almost nonexistent but that is the world we trufally have no real control over with any search program very handy to schedule multiple sms texts always works as advertised nothing more nothing less and i m extremely careful about security and privacy this app appears squeeky clean to me after a year of regular use and even multiple app updates google do not remove this app it shows the very body and spirit of apps that should be allowed to continue providing safe robust options for android users customizability is one of the few remaining features that sets android above ios not gimp uses a virtual machine with very little security any image you try to edit is uploaded to a server other people can see what you upload you can see what other people upload completely useless app you will be bombarded with telemarketers call just to make you pay more for subscription lack of security don t install this app recent version of app intrudes privacy location permissions are required to enable bluetooth a serious non-voluntary privacy violation please revert to old app permissions so my daughter can keep using her sonicare do not use this it s just a remote connection to a single virtual desktop running old style gimp anything you save and actually can make will be saved on the public server and anybody can view it do not download lots of security problems possible here bloody privacy reminder takes up a lot of screen and u cant get rid of it some parts of website not viewable because of that i am using ecosia from now on and i hope u do to obsessive compulsory stalking app for zero but effects to hatred confusion and abduction unlawfulness and psychological torment to traumatic brain injured people like me for example a non duplicated phone is privacy for individuals as my suspicious solo investigation onto other states countries and jurisdictions nations continues for common and uncommon cause humanely god godesses blessed unblessed ouvre ce la vie the app has recently been updated or changed so as to no longer respect android privacy settings in order to schedule curbside pickup the app demands you change your settings to allow amazon to monitor your location 24x7 even when the app is not in use previously it could be set to only get location access when the app was in use this surveillance is highly disconcerting it such a good application for me to learn english not only english but many languages and meet people all around the world it is save and will keep our privacy if we need it we can accept and neglect people who disagree with our passion getting better love the progress and glad it is now more reliable very good app excellent they have security protocols so that the photo of the person corresponds to the profile in this app i found the love of my life very unpleasant experience and the app is totally unreliable i even upgraded to paid premium membership and i see my personal profile basic details are getting changed automatically i had to update the details everyday and just after few hours details are changed even after repeated complaints to the customer care service doesn t help changed my security details passwords repeatedly but same issue will never recommend and don t upgrade to paid membership pathetic and worst experience ever i m not sure if google is listening to my conversations or tracking everything happening near my fingertips and across all devices linked to my common networks but i m thankful the news are quite relevant and best of all free google does a way better job at showing relevant feeds than facebook as to privacy i guess i just have to trust that google won t abuse it huawei seems to be catching up pretty well too hopefully neither will put me behind bars for funny speculative reasons haha the battery details you want w the charging info you need permission privacy secure -only in-app purchases which is why i tested this app no fake promises if a batteries dead ummmm it s dead unless your phone is rooted no app change specs 2 improve life lastly my li-ion battery doesn t take pics-while uploading to its cloud why would it need media wifi permissions cheers great app awesome app this app is most useful for lock the gallery this is very useful for privacy nothing but ads no pick up lines just privacy invading ads don t install report to google total scam crash ask for phone identity and refuse to start if denied if you are not at all interested in sharing our profile with only specified matches of us then why do you even ask the non specified people are visiting my profile when i have clearly mentioned my preferences and the second thing is only after getting myself registered with u another web site hav got my contact and profile details and now they are sending me mails without me approving may i know if it was u who shared my details with thm where the hell is customer profile security is here it s an ok search engine has some good features but it needs some tweaking seems like i get more and better results with other search engines not a bad search engine it does give you more personal privacy than a leading well know competitor it s good worth the download if you want a change from the corp owned engines it was good and helpfully keeping privacy also i can t believe this app allows me to register same email twice without even prompted me with wrong password nowadays we use lots of email i didn t logged out but when i try to do purchase i was informed i wasn t log in and now my email is suspended permanently i have to register new email they don t even take responsibility for their own mistake i should be the one who ask how can you register same email twice that s security issue i would not recommed this app to anyone uninstall this app has serious problem when clicked on certain areas it opens malicious website and continuously ask to install uc browser it hangs the app and gives problem to mobile developers and security people need to check this app i wanted to use this but you collect far too much personal data for my comfort looks pretty but privacy is far more important 4 stars a free app that appears to make learning new words easy and intuitive it does require considerable access to the phone - access to phone status and storage - leaving me to question the privacy of the app they added ads that appear when you view your day i emailed them only to find my privacy was being invaded and would continue to be with these intrusive ad suggestions i suggested just a pop up when you open the ap would be less invasive to no avail i am looking for another calendar ap every update makes it worse the text is so small that you can t see your month you have to search each day back and fort back and forth if you enlarge you lose viewing half of the calendar cant zoom i like the features of this app but it concerns me that there is no security information the only information it gives you is telling you to read the microsoft privacy statement which does not state anything about the your phone app for an app that s designed to send personal data from one device to another i expect some explanation on how that information is being secured for that reason i can t recommend this app at the moment this used to be a great application but the most recent update requires you use an account and upload your data their response is that this is to handle constant complaints about accidentally losing data but that is baloney this is now an application that forcefully spies on you and likely sells your data shame on you deleted anyone that remotely cares about their privacy should stay away i don t feel their experience to be described able as i observed this is a virtual machine and one can see the images uploaded by others also this application shows a great privacy theft possibility and its great threat to your system and your images if you want to share all your pictures to others then you can use this application otherwise please keep in mind that it is all the pictures that you use will be shared with others also the app is asking lots of phone permission eg access to ur phone call records and able to manage ur phone call if u refuse the app cannot be used i wonder why taobao needs to invade my privacy in order for me to buy an item uninstalled within 5 mins of installation the app is asking lots of phone permission eg access to ur phone call records and able to manage ur phone call if u refuse the app cannot be used i wonder why taobao needs to invade my privacy in order for me to buy an item uninstalled within 5 mins of installation exellent apps security and privacy of individual needs more confidence doesn t have enough security i kept getting pop-up asking to upgrade my phone or that my phone is infected with virus etc and keeps going to playstore making it impossible to shop leisurely the first time i did manage to buy something i was overcharged after complaining via email they insisted it was correct despite me sending a snapshot of proof then they stopped responding despite my follow up so unscrupulous i like it cuz hopefully it s privacy and calling it is not a good thing too much internet interruption but most of all it is a good thing
